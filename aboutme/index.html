    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>I am in my third semester at BYU-Idaho attending in person.
        I am 22 years-old and I was born in the south of Brazil, I moved to the United States
        when I was around 12. I currently live in Florida, and I absolutely love it. I enjoy traveling,
        learning, lifting, playing the guitar, playing video games, and reading.

    <p>
        One recent gospel principle I have been enjoying learning about is the connection between humility, pride, and
        revelation.
        Proverbs 15:14,21, 2 Nephi 15:21, 2 Nephi 9:42. These are all great scriptures that have been teaching me quite
        a bit.
